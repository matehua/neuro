Similar to the well-established hip and knee joint replacement procedures, the evolution of artificial disc prostheses may also result in a dramatic improvement in patients' quality of life and achieve high levels of patient satisfaction.",

Multiple investigations have shown superior patient outcomes, higher patient satisfaction rates, reduced rate of re-operations, fewer complications and reduced costs after arthroplasty when compared with spinal fusion in properly selected candidates.",
