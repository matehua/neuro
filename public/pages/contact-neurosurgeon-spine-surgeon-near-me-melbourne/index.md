MEDICARE REBATES

## GP and Specialist Referrals

A current referral from a general practitioner (GP) or specialist is required for all new patients to claim Medicare rebate. GP referrals are usually valid for 12 months and specialist’s referrals for 3 months. Ideally, results of current radiological imaging (<12 months old) should be attached to a referral.  
  
After receiving a referral, the patient will be contacted by our staff to arrange an [appointment](https://neurosurgeon.au/appointments/).

TAC AND WORKCOVER WELCOME

## Insurances

**Private:** Patients must have valid private health/hospital insurance with no waiting periods. Extras are not valid. The health funds don’t contribute to consultation fees.  
  
**TAC:** Claim details and consultation approval from [TAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAC).  
  
**Veteran Affairs/Military:** Both “Gold Card” and “White Card” patients are eligible. For “White Card” holders, a condition must be covered by DVA.  
  
**Work Cover:** Claim details and consultation approval from the insurer. Patients must pay the consultation fee upfront and claim reimbursement from their insurer.  
  
**Uninsured:** Self-funded patients can be provided with a quote for all surgical, anaesthetic and hospital costs. As an example, the minimum amount required for a single-segment spinal surgery not requiring any implants in a private hospital in Victoria can be around $15000 – $20000. For all other uninsured referrals, please contact the closest public hospital directly.
