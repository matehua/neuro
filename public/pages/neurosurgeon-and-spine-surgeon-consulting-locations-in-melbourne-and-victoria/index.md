INITIAL CONSULTATION

## In Person or by Telehealth

Before the actual appointment, our office will liaise with your GP to obtain a referral and relevant medical information, including results of previous imaging, nerve conduction tests, EMG and other radiological and neurophysiological investigations. All new patients will be asked to fill the detailed registration form to understand the nature and urgency of your problem, past history, current symptoms, previous treatment and other general health issues which may be relevant for your treatment. If you were injured in workplace, traffic or other accident, please provide accurate description of the incident circumstances, as they play major role in understanding mechanism of injury and planning appropriate management strategy. You are welcome to prepare the list of your questions and important matters you wish to discuss and to send it to us so that we can save your time in the consulting room and focus on your problem.  
  
As most private radiology practices in Australia (e.g. I-MED, Capital Radiology, Healthcare Imaging, Regional Imaging and others in Victoria) allow online access to imaging performed over the past 3 – 4 years, you don’t need to worry about it. It is however important to bring your scans, films or CD-ROMs if you had investigations overseas, in public hospitals or prior to digital era. Dr Aliashkevich will assess all available information and form preliminary plan before meeting you in person. You will receive a reminder SMS confirming appointment time and location 2 or 3 days in advance. For your convenience, we are happy to offer all forms of telehealth consultations, including phone, Skype, Zoom, Facetime and other suitable conferencing options of your preference.
