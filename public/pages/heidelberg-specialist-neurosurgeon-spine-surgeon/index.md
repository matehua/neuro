### Common questions about Neurosurgery and Spine Surgery

TAILORED PLAN

## Therapeutic Interventions

Thorough evaluation and diagnosis, utilising advanced imaging techniques and neurophysiological testing, allows us to pinpoint the underlying cause of your symptoms. Once a diagnosis is established, [Dr Aliashkevich](https://mpscentre.com.au/dt_team/dr-ales-aliashkevich/) collaborates closely with other specialists in Heidelberg and Melbourne to develop a tailored therapeutic plan designed to address your specific needs. It may include:

##### Interventional Procedures

In addition to traditional medical therapies, Dr Aliashkevich can offer a variety of minimally invasive interventional procedures to target pain and inflammation directly at the source, providing relief and promoting healing.

##### Physical Therapy and Hydrotherapy

Personalised exercise programs to improve posture, strength, flexibility, and mobility.

##### Rehabilitation

Critical component for postoperative recovery to maximise function, independence, and quality of life.

## Specialist care in a welcoming and comfortable environment

Dr Aliashkevich wants his patients to be fully engaged in their treatment process and have a good understanding of their neurosurgical conditions. Hence, the rooms are equipped with large displays to review and discuss the imaging and make important decisions about the treatment options and available alternatives. We believe partnering with patients in their care is a modern gold standard for medical treatment and aim to deliver ethical and professional services to improve the quality of doctor-patient interactions. At the end of every patient's visit, our office emails a summary of their conditions, including the diagnosis, history, examination findings, radiological results and recommended action plan.

#### Comfortable consulting rooms

Our neurosurgical consulting rooms are patient-centric, allowing them to feel comfortable and relaxed when discussing important health issues. Every examination room has an accessible adjustable-height exam table and sufficient clear floor space next to it. There is plenty of space for wheelchair access and capacity for accompanying persons and family members. Hand sanitisers are available in all consulting and waiting spaces.

#### Convenient waiting space

The waiting areas are designed and fitted out with the patient's experience in mind. They convey neatness and a warm and welcoming feeling to help patients feel comfortable and at ease. Wider seats allow for separation from strangers, room for personal belongings, child prams and adequate support. The seating and spacing elements allow for privacy and safety. Knowing how valuable is our patients' time, we take care to keep the waiting period as short as possible and make the waiting area as convenient as possible.
