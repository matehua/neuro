### Why You Should Visit Mornington Specialist Centre

TAILORED PLAN

## Therapeutic Interventions

Thorough evaluation and diagnosis, utilising advanced imaging techniques and neurophysiological testing, allows us to pinpoint the underlying cause of your symptoms. Once a diagnosis is established, Dr Aliashkevich collaborates closely with other specialists in Frankston and Mornington Peninsula to develop a tailored therapeutic plan designed to address your specific needs. It may include:

##### Interventional Procedures

In addition to traditional medical therapies, Dr Aliashkevich can offer a variety of minimally invasive interventional procedures to target pain and inflammation directly at the source, providing relief and promoting healing.

##### Physical Therapy and Hydrotherapy

Personalised exercise programs to improve posture, strength, flexibility, and mobility.

##### Rehabilitation

Critical component for postoperative recovery to maximise function, independence, and quality of life.

## Specialist care in a welcoming and comfortable environment

Dr Aliashkevich wants his patients to be fully engaged in their treatment process and have a good understanding of their neurosurgical conditions. Hence, the rooms are equipped with large displays to review and discuss the imaging and make important decisions about the treatment options and available alternatives. We believe partnering with patients in their care is a modern gold standard for medical treatment and aim to deliver ethical and professional services to improve the quality of doctor-patient interactions. At the end of every patient's visit, our office emails a summary of their conditions, including the diagnosis, history, examination findings, radiological results and recommended action plan.

#### Comfortable consulting rooms

Our neurosurgical consulting rooms are patient-centric, allowing them to feel comfortable and relaxed when discussing important health issues. Every examination room has an accessible adjustable-height exam table and sufficient clear floor space next to it. There is plenty of space for wheelchair access and capacity for accompanying persons and family members. Hand sanitisers are available in all consulting and waiting spaces.

#### Convenient waiting space

The waiting areas are designed and fitted out with the patient's experience in mind. They convey neatness and a warm and welcoming feeling to help patients feel comfortable and at ease. Wider seats allow for separation from strangers, room for personal belongings, child prams and adequate support. The seating and spacing elements allow for privacy and safety. Knowing how valuable is our patients' time, we take care to keep the waiting period as short as possible and make the waiting area as convenient as possible.

#### Patients' privacy

Dr Aliashkevich pays great respect to patient's privacy and provides a safe environment. The goal is to build and maintain trust between the neurosurgeon and the patient.

TAC AND WORKCOVER WELCOME

## Insurances and Surgery Funding

### **Private:** Patients must have valid [private health/hospital insurance](https://www.privatehealth.gov.au/) with no waiting periods. Extras are not applicable for inpatient hospital treatment. The health funds don’t contribute to consultation and outpatient treatment fees.  
Please note that so-called basic and bronze covers may not cover spinal surgery or neurosurgery in private hospitals. [Cervical](https://neurosurgeon.au/cervical-disc-replacement-spine-surgery-melbourne/) and [lumbar artificial disc replacement](https://neurosurgeon.au/lumbar-disc-replacement/) (arthroplasty) falls into the Joint Replacement Category, which is usually included in Silver and Gold policies. Patients need to check their policy for coverage levels, exclusions, and inclusions.  
  
**TAC:** Claim details and consultation approval from [TAC](https://www.tac.vic.gov.au/). Patients must pay the consultation fee upfront and claim reimbursement from their insurer.  
  
**Veteran Affairs/Military:** Both “Gold Card” and “White Card” patients are eligible. For “White Card” holders, a condition must be covered by [DVA](https://www.dva.gov.au/).  
  
**Work Cover:** Claim details and consultation approval from the [WorkSafe insurer](https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/). Patients must pay the consultation fee upfront and claim reimbursement from their insurer.  
  
**Uninsured:** Self-funded patients can be provided with a quote for all surgical, anaesthetic and hospital costs. For example, the minimum amount required for a single-segment spinal surgery not requiring any implants in a private hospital in Victoria can be around $15000 – $20000. This amount may include hospital and operating theatre fees, surgeon, assistant, anaesthetist, specialised care from a perioperative physician, and HDU or ICU care.  
  
Dr Aliashkevich has no affiliation with a public hospital, so unless a patient is willing to pay for surgery in a private hospital, he cannot undertake surgery on someone without appropriate insurance. For all other uninsured referrals, please get in touch with the closest public hospital directly.
