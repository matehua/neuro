## General Questions

Common questions about neurosurgical consultations and care

### What is a neurosurgeon and how is it different from other specialists?

A neurosurgeon is a medical specialist who diagnoses and treats conditions affecting the brain, spine, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Unlike neurologists who primarily manage neurological conditions with medications and other non-surgical treatments, neurosurgeons are trained to perform surgical interventions. Orthopaedic surgeons may also operate on the spine, but neurosurgeons have specialized training in treating conditions that affect the nervous system, including the spinal cord and nerve roots.

### Do I need a referral to see Dr Aliashkevich?

Yes, you will need a referral from your GP or another specialist to see Dr Aliashkevich. This is required for Medicare rebates and ensures that all relevant medical information is provided before your consultation. The referral helps Dr Aliashkevich understand your medical history and the specific concerns that led to your referral.

### How long will I need to wait for an appointment?

Waiting times vary depending on the urgency of your condition. Urgent cases are typically seen within 1-2 weeks, while non-urgent consultations may have a waiting period of 3-4 weeks. If your condition requires immediate attention, please ensure your referring doctor indicates this on your referral letter, and our staff will prioritize your appointment accordingly.

## Cervical Disc Replacement

Questions about artificial disc replacement in the neck

### What is cervical disc replacement and how does it differ from fusion?

Cervical disc replacement (also called cervical arthroplasty) is a motion-preserving procedure where a damaged disc in the neck is replaced with an artificial disc. Unlike traditional fusion surgery which permanently joins two vertebrae together, disc replacement maintains natural neck movement. This preservation of motion reduces stress on adjacent discs, potentially decreasing the risk of adjacent segment disease. Dr Aliashkevich is a strong advocate for motion-preserving techniques when appropriate for the patient's condition.

### How long does recovery take after cervical disc replacement?

Recovery after cervical disc replacement is typically faster than fusion surgery. Most patients stay in hospital for 1-2 nights and can return to light activities within a few days. Many patients report immediate improvement in arm pain following surgery. Neck discomfort and swallowing difficulties usually resolve within 1-2 weeks. Most patients can return to office work within 2-3 weeks and more physical jobs within 6-8 weeks. Full recovery with maximum benefit is usually achieved by 3 months. For instance, Michael, a 38-year-old IT professional, was back to work within 10 days of his procedure and resumed his regular tennis matches after 6 weeks.

### What types of artificial discs does Dr Aliashkevich use?

Dr Aliashkevich is experienced with multiple artificial disc designs and selects the most appropriate one based on the patient's anatomy and specific condition. He commonly uses the CP-ESP disc, which features a polycarbonate urethane core that mimics natural disc movement, and the Mobi-C disc, which is approved for both single and two-level replacements. Other options include the Prestige LP, ProDisc-C, and M6 discs. Each has unique design features that may make them more suitable for certain patients. During your consultation, Dr Aliashkevich will discuss which option would be most beneficial for your specific situation.

### Can I have an MRI after getting an artificial disc?

Yes, most modern artificial discs are MRI compatible. While the metallic components may produce some image distortion (artifacts) around the implant area, this doesn't prevent MRI scanning of other body regions. The area immediately surrounding the implant may be better visualized using CT scans. Always inform your healthcare provider about your implant before undergoing any imaging studies. Dr Aliashkevich selects implants that minimize imaging interference for future diagnostic needs.

## Lumbar Disc Replacement

Questions about artificial disc replacement in the lower back

### What is lumbar disc replacement and how does it compare to fusion?

Lumbar disc replacement is a motion-preserving procedure where a damaged disc in the lower back is replaced with an artificial disc. Unlike spinal fusion which eliminates motion between vertebrae, disc replacement maintains natural movement at that level. This preservation of motion helps distribute forces more naturally through the spine, potentially reducing the risk of adjacent segment degeneration. Dr Aliashkevich favors motion-preserving approaches when appropriate as they often allow for faster recovery and better long-term outcomes.

### Who is an ideal candidate for lumbar disc replacement?

Ideal candidates for lumbar disc replacement typically have back pain primarily from degenerative disc disease at one or two levels, have failed conservative treatments for at least 6 months, have no significant facet joint arthritis, maintain good bone quality, and have no major deformity or instability. Age is also a consideration, with better outcomes typically seen in patients under 60. For example, James, a 45-year-old construction manager with debilitating back pain from a degenerative disc at L4-5 who had tried physiotherapy and pain management without success, experienced a 90% reduction in pain following his lumbar disc replacement.

### How long will an artificial lumbar disc last?

Modern artificial lumbar discs are designed for durability and longevity. Clinical studies have shown good outcomes with follow-up periods of 10+ years. The implants undergo rigorous testing, with many designs showing minimal wear even after millions of cycles of movement. For instance, the LP-ESP disc used by Dr Aliashkevich has demonstrated excellent durability in long-term studies. While no implant can be guaranteed to last a lifetime, the current generation of artificial discs is expected to function well for many years in appropriately selected patients.

### What restrictions will I have after lumbar disc replacement?

Initially after surgery, you'll need to avoid heavy lifting (nothing over 5kg) and excessive bending or twisting for about 6 weeks. Most patients can resume light activities and walking within days of surgery. Driving is typically permitted once you're off strong pain medication, usually within 1-2 weeks. After the initial recovery period, most patients can gradually return to normal activities, including sports and exercise, with few permanent restrictions. Dr Aliashkevich has treated several athletes who have returned to competitive sports after lumbar disc replacement, including a 36-year-old amateur triathlete who completed a half Ironman 9 months after surgery.

### What is the success rate for lumbar disc replacement?

Clinical studies show success rates of 70-90% for appropriately selected patients undergoing lumbar disc replacement. 'Success' is typically defined as significant pain reduction, improved function, and patient satisfaction. Dr Aliashkevich's patients often experience substantial improvement in pain and quality of life. For example, Emma, a 52-year-old nurse with debilitating back pain that prevented her from working, returned to full-time nursing duties 3 months after her lumbar disc replacement with minimal discomfort. It's important to note that proper patient selection is crucial for good outcomes, which is why Dr Aliashkevich conducts thorough assessments before recommending this procedure.

## Advanced Robotic and Minimally Invasive Techniques

Questions about cutting-edge neurosurgical technologies

### What types of spinal conditions can be treated with robotic surgery?

Robotic technology can be applied to various spinal procedures, including spinal fusions, screw placements, decompression surgeries, and correction of spinal deformities. It's particularly valuable for complex cases involving difficult anatomy or revision surgeries. The technology is most commonly used for conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, spinal instability, and certain spinal deformities. Dr Aliashkevich evaluates each case individually to determine if robotic assistance would provide significant benefits for the specific procedure.

## Insurance, Costs and Practical Information

Questions about insurance coverage, costs, and preparing for treatment

### What should I bring to my first consultation?

For your first consultation, please bring:
1) Your referral letter from your GP or specialist
2) Your Medicare card and private health insurance details
3) Any relevant imaging (MRI, CT scans, X-rays) on disc if possible, or at minimum the reports
4) A list of all current medications and dosages
5) A list of any allergies
6) Previous medical reports related to your condition
7) A list of questions you'd like to ask

Being well-prepared helps Dr Aliashkevich provide the most thorough assessment possible. Many patients find it helpful to bring a support person who can help remember important information discussed during the consultation.

### How long are Dr Aliashkevich's waiting lists for surgery?

Surgical waiting times vary depending on the urgency of your condition and the type of procedure required. For urgent cases, surgery can often be arranged within 1-2 weeks. For non-urgent elective procedures, the waiting period is typically 4-6 weeks. Dr Aliashkevich works across multiple hospitals in Melbourne, which provides flexibility in scheduling. If your condition requires prompt attention, this will be prioritized accordingly. For example, when David presented with progressive neurological symptoms from cervical spinal cord compression, his surgery was expedited and performed within 5 days of his initial consultation.
