## Appointments

* * *

After taking your history and performing examinations, your imaging will be reviewed and discussed with you. Understanding the problem is essential in finding the best possible solution and good quality radiological investigations play an important role in visualising any structural changes and abnormalities.  
Very often, additional and more detailed radiological investigations will be required. These may include:  
– MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) including weight-bearing scans and MR angiography,  
– CT (computed tomography),  
– SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography),  
– flexion/extension, lateral bending and other specific types of X-Rays,  
– EOS imaging (low dose 3D imaging in natural standing position),  
– DEXA bone mineral density measurements,  
– ultrasound and other studies.  
For certain neurological conditions, you may be referred to neurophysiological investigations, including nerve conduction studies, EMG (electromyogram), SSEP (somato-sensory evoked potentials) and MEP (motor evoked potentials).

## Treatment Decisions

* * *

Once the cause of your problem is identified, we will discuss suitable management options. In most situations, there is more than one option available and surgery will be only the last resort when every other form of conservative treatment fails to improve your condition.   
In order to help you make the right decision, we will discuss pros and cons of all possible modalities and explain expected outcomes during consultation. You will be provided with detailed information materials relevant to your condition to take home and discuss with your family.   
A report to your General Practitioner will be dictated at the end of appointment and a copy will be sent to you as well.  
  
Our primary goal would be to avoid operation, and this approach is proven as the safest and most effective in many scenarios. However, there are situations when surgery is the final and necessary step to improve patient’s condition and quality of life.   
When it comes to surgery, it is naturally not always easy to make this important decision. Understanding the problem and range of available alternatives is very helpful.
