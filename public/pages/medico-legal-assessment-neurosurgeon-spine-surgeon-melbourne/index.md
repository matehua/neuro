UNBIASED INDEPENDENT EXPERT REVIEW

## Medicolegal Assessments

Medical examinations form a crucial part of the personal injury and compensation claim assessment. Lawyers, insurers or other parties can request them. They should be performed by the unbiased independent experts who have appropriate qualifications, deep knowledge of the problem and are specifically trained to provide impairment ratings. As an expert witness and healthcare professional, Dr Aliashkevich has a duty to the court to provide an impartial opinion and is not influenced in his opinion by anything but his experience and expertise.  
  
Medicolegal assessment is different from the usual medical or specialist consultation because no patient-doctor relationship is formed, no rereferrals for any investigations are provided, and no treatments are prescribed. The information collected during the appointment is not confidential and will be released to the lawyers and, if required, to the insurer and The Court. This assessment goes much deeper into the claimant’s history, vocational background, employment, accident circumstances and activities of daily living. This evidence is generally collected from the claimant directly and from the supportive documentation. The client or his legal representative is responsible for providing all relevant notes, reports, scans or X-rays before the appointment.  
  
Accurate history is a crucial part of any report, and having just a single conversation with a client like many other examiners do is not sufficient. Clients often complain about memory problems, suffer from mental health problems, take regular opioids/antidepressants/benzodiazepines and may not always provide the same information when asked twice, in particular when feeling pressure form examiners.  
  
Our history collection process involves five separate steps and is much more reliable than just a one-off personal chat:  
  
1\. Provided Dr Aliashkevich thoroughly reviews legal documents and analyses the background information. Every possible inconsistency will be identified to be double-checked before seeing the client. Hence it is important to have the documents at least three days in advance so that we have time to read them.  
2\. All available radiology providers are checked for relevant scans, and the dates of investigations/referrals are noted. The relevant images reviewed and selected for presentation in the final report.  
3\. Clients are asked to fill the forms with the details and dates of their injuries. If clients have difficulty writing/understanding questions, they are helped by assistants. We aim to send the forms to clients well in advance so that they can prepare them at their convenience and understand what questions will be asked during the appointment. The filled forms will be reviewed by Dr Aliashkevich and compared for consistency with the history obtained in steps 1 and 2. 
4\. The history is recorded from clients in a personal conversation, and any missing details or inconsistencies from steps 1-3 will be clarified. The history is summarised in the client’s presence so that they can make any amendments directly. The handwritten notes will be collected and stored in a file for further reference.  
5\. When clients leave, their history is again double-checked for consistency with available records, scans and examination findings. If any important pieces of information are missing or require verification, we will get clarification and updates before sending the final report to lawyers or insurers.  
  
Hence, the clients are encouraged to take plenty of time to get prepared for their appointment and to collect all relevant documents, scans, list of medications and other supporting records. Depending on the type of assessment, the interview and examination may last a long time, and it is important not to feel any time pressure or be under stress.\\

PREPARATION IN COMFORT

## Before the Medicolegal Appointment

As many of our clients suffer from chronic pain and psychological problems form their injuries, we want to reduce the discomfort of the examination and collect as much information about the injury and its consequences well in advance. We understand that undergoing a medicolegal assessment and going through the details of the injury over and over again can cause additional distress. To reduce the pressure of prolonged medical examination and to allow comfortable preparation, our medicolegal assistant will provide a registration form, health questionnaire and consent form well in advance before the date of the actual appointment.   
  
He/she can also help to answer some questions and make sure that all concerns are covered. We want to make our clients feel as comfortable as possible during their assessment and strive to help to fill the registration form and interview to persons with reading/writing problems. Having a structured questionnaire helps to focus even on the smallest details of the incident and resulting incapacity which may not be initially considered as necessary by the injured person.   
  
The questions will cover various aspects of pre-injury activities, medical history, accident circumstances, treatment received, current medications and injury impacts on daily life, mobility, hobbies etc. Our medicolegal assistant will be delighted to take enough time and to provide guidance through all the fields in the form and to make sure that nothing is missed or overseen. Sometimes, a long time passes after the injury, and the dates or the events may be forgotten. We want to make sure that all the relevant information is recalled and provided during the interview to prepare a robust and comprehensive final report. We will be happy to provide a photocopy of the filled questionnaire on request.  
  
For their comfort, the claimants are welcome to have a support person, carer or legal guardian. A professional interpreter can be arranged if required. Family or friends may not be considered as appropriate interpreters by lawyers or insurers. We can arrange for a chaperone to be present when Dr Aliashkevich performs an examination.

ATTENTION TO DETAIL

## During the Appointment

We always aim to start the appointment on the specified time, but sometimes practising surgeons have to deal with emergencies that may cause delays. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience and appreciate the client’s understanding and patience.  
  
The appointment usually consists of 4 parts:  
  
– explanation of the purpose of the assessment;  
– interview;  
– examination;  
– time for any comments and conclusion.  
  
Interview  
  
The interview includes a discussion of the following topics:  
– a history of any relevant pre-existing medical conditions, including when and how they began, what treatment was required and was the outcome;  
– if any medical tests and scans were undertaken before the injury;  
– educational background and work history;  
– the accident or circumstances that caused the injury;  
– the investigations and treatment received after the injury;  
– current complaints and symptoms;  
– current work capacity;  
– current medications;  
– general health matters;  
– the injury impact on basic mobility (standing, sitting, walking, driving), daily living (cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping) and the ability for self-care;  
– the effect of the injury on quality of life, personal, social and recreational activities, i.e. hobbies, sports, family life etc.;  
The previously filled questionnaire will be discussed to clarify the answers and to expand on some points if needed.  
  
Examination  
  
The neurological examination is not expected to cause any additional pain. It involves measuring height and weight, the circumference of the arms and legs, testing reflexes, sensation, movement of various joints and identifying the affected body parts. The examination is focussed of the injured body part and doesn’t require to undress a client fully. Some clothes may need to be removed to visualise the injured area and note any scarring. The photographs can be taken to document any scars, injuries, deformities, movement restrictions or walking aids as discreetly as possible. The images will be included in the final report and may also serve the identification purposes. These images will be stored securely and deleted six months after the report has been finalised.  
  
Video conferences  
  
Some interviews can be conducted via phone or video conference using Zoom, Skype and similar applications. The report will state that and outline any limitations. A link to join the conference is provided either by email or text message. Parts of the videoconference may be recorded, and screenshots may be taken to include into the final report. All personal and confidential information is securely stored and deleted six months after the report has been finalised.

HIGHEST QUALITY REPORTS

## After the Appointment

Medicolegal reports provide significantly more detail than the usual specialist’s letters. They are legal documents which can be used as evidence in courts. In some complex cases, reports can be 30-50 pages long. Analysis of literature and additional evidence (e.g. video footage, surveillance materials) may be required in some situations. Understandably, it may take several weeks to analyse all the evidence and to prepare a comprehensive report which can be presented to a judge and jury.  
   
After the report is finalised, it will be sent directly to the requesting party. As a general rule, Dr Aliashkevich doesn’t mind for his reports to be forwarded to the claimants or their general practitioners if they help with future treatment planning.
