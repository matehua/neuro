### 2. Medical Indications
**Purpose**: Define when cervical disc replacement is appropriate

**Indication Categories**:
- **Primary Indications**
  - Degenerative disc disease
  - Herniated cervical discs with radiculopathy
  - Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
  - Failed conservative treatment

- **Patient Selection Criteria**
  - Age considerations (typically 21-60 years)
  - Single or two-level disease
  - Adequate bone quality
  - Absence of significant facet arthritis

### 3. Surgical Technique
**Purpose**: Explain the surgical procedure and approach
