# 🎯 **FINAL ERROR RESOLUTION - Translation Loading Issue COMPLETELY FIXED**

## **✅ ERROR STATUS: RESOLVED**

The runtime error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hero')` has been **completely resolved**. The application now loads perfectly in both English and Chinese without any errors.

---

## **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Error**
```
Expertise.tsx:50 
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hero')
    at Expertise (Expertise.tsx:50:34)
```

### **The Problem**
The error occurred because the Expertise component was trying to access `safeExpertisePage.hero.title` on line 50, but the `expertisePage` section was **missing from the English translation file** (`src/locales/en.ts`).

### **The Chain of Failure**
1. Component loads and tries to access `finalT?.expertisePage || en.expertisePage`
2. `finalT?.expertisePage` is undefined (Chinese translation loading)
3. `en.expertisePage` is also undefined (missing from English file)
4. `safeExpertisePage` becomes undefined
5. Accessing `safeExpertisePage.hero.title` throws the error

## **🔧 Solution Implemented**

### **Added Missing Translation Section**
**File**: `src/locales/en.ts`

**Added Complete `expertisePage` Section**:
```typescript
expertisePage: {
  hero: {
    title: "Neurosurgical Expertise",
    subtitle: "Explore our neurosurgical specialties from spine surgery to brain tumor removal."
  },
  introduction: {
