## ⚡ IDENTIFIED OPTIMIZATIONS

### **Medium Priority Issues (5 items):**

1. **React Import Warnings (4 instances)**
   - **Issue:** Some components use JSX without explicit React import
   - **Impact:** Low (React 17+ automatic JSX transform handles this)
   - **Fix:** Optional - add explicit imports for clarity
   - **Priority:** Low

2. **Translation Key Mismatch (1 instance)**
   - **Issue:** 492 missing Chinese translations
   - **Impact:** Medium (affects Chinese user experience)
   - **Fix:** Add missing translations to zh.ts
   - **Priority:** Medium

### **Performance Suggestions (50 items):**

1. **Large Components (5 critical)**
   - Components with 400+ lines could be split for maintainability
   - Largest: 891 lines, 824 lines, 767 lines, 721 lines, 416 lines
   - **Impact:** Maintainability (not performance)
   - **Priority:** Low

2. **Potential Optimizations (45 items)**
   - Consider React.memo for frequently re-rendering components
   - Move inline objects/functions outside render methods
   - **Impact:** Minor performance gains
   - **Priority:** Very Low
